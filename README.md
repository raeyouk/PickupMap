<h2> FindMyRide </h2>

This website uses a dataset containing the locations, times, and other information on where rideshare users were picked up in New York City. The rideshare companies include Uber, Lyft, Diplo, Carmel, and Dial7. With input from the user, the map is populated with these pickup locations, serving as a coverage map of rideshare companies around the user's area. This can help users make informed decisions on which company would be the best option to use based on their current location.

Thanks to Samantha Axline and Sreeja Kondeti for helping me with the backend.
